This project was graded <strong>125/100</strong>.


## ðŸ“’ **About**
> This is the first project not involving much of the 42-programming side. You'll be challenged to setup a Virtual Machine, where you will be the owner. You'll learn about OS, job scheduling, shell commands, permissions, package managing, and many other areas. You won't be able to use a graphical interface though...

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation**
> The Virtual Machine has around 60GB and is cyphered with a passphrase, so in this repository you will only find a script which is meant to run every 10 min after the machine starts.
